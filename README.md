# 🤖 Hand Gesture Recognition with Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a real-time hand gesture recognition system using computer vision and machine learning. By leveraging webcam input and a custom-trained classification model, the system can accurately identify various hand gestures such as ✋ Stop, 👋 Wave, 🤞 Peace, 👍 Thumbs-up, and more.

## 🚀 Goals

- Real-time hand gesture detection via webcam
- Classify predefined gestures using a CNN ML model
- Deploy on embedded devices 
- Build an intuitive UI for live feedback and testing

## 📦 Technologies Used

- To be updated
